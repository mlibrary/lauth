managed flag
works against manager column on the collection
the only collection we use it for is where the manager column is 0
this corresponds to the "root" group
some LIT people are members of this group
primarily for stats
normal aa_coll_obj path/setup as with other scenarios
behaves like a normal collectio with a group grant except that the authorized collection
  list has the value of All. These lists are empty for normal mode; minimally a colon
  in delegated. Managed is All.


coll column on aa_network:
we don't think any of these are relevant anymore.
be careful and do some testing about these scenarios
except 'robots', which we can and will handle this solely in the apache config.

ip pw any
There are three rows with ip
we don't think they're legitimate
like they are named authz-test-(blah)
it should ignore user credentials
but apache won't let us both:
  - allow someone without credentials
  - allow someone with credentials but don't use those credentials


empty string should be ":"
we also need leading and trailing delimeters ":pub1:" and ":foo:bar:"

  describe "regex test sanity checking" do
    it { expect(":").to match_collection_string_format }
    it { expect(":foo:").to match_collection_string_format }
    it { expect(":foo:bar:").to match_collection_string_format }
    it { expect(":foo:bar:").to match_collection_string_format }
    it { expect(":foo:bar").to_not match_collection_string_format }
    it { expect("foo:bar:").to_not match_collection_string_format }
    it { expect("").to_not match_collection_string_format }
    it { expect("::").to_not match_collection_string_format }
  end
